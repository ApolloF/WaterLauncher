# WaterLauncher plan

Status: **v1.2 released** (2026-09-26); v1.0 and v1.1 before it, v0.1 to v0.7 as prereleases. Alongside: [gamekit](https://github.com/ApolloF/gamekit) v0.1.0, Syncer 0.11.0 (launcher API) and DLSS Updater 1.4.0 (add-on mode). Code signing waits for a certificate ([SIGNING.md](SIGNING.md)). Section 17 has the v1.0 details and what comes after.
Design reference: [WaterLauncher Design Directions](https://claude.ai/artifact/EUqrFQcmgAThrxbm8vAr6i) (A Console, B Orbit, C Deck, D Desktop).

## 1. Goals

- A Windows game launcher that finds games on its own: store installs and unofficial copies (emulated Steam, repacks, GOG rips, plain folders), and adds art and metadata the way Playnite does for Steam games.
- Two modes: **Desktop** (mouse, layout D) and **Big picture** (controller). Big picture has three layouts, picked in Settings: **Deck (default)**, Console, Orbit.
- First-class DualSense: native input, glyphs, haptics, lightbar, and the PS button to summon the launcher. Games without DualSense support start through Steam Input automatically. Games that support it start directly.
- Syncer integration: save status per game, sync before launch, back up after exit, conflicts.
- Add-ons through hooks, starting with DLSS Updater.
- Pretty, responsive, secure and light: the interface unloads while you play.

Not in v1: downloading games or cracks (WaterLauncher only manages what's installed), emulators and ROMs, achievements, macOS or Linux, importing from Playnite.

## 2. Decisions

| Area | Decision |
|---|---|
| Stack | Go + Wails **v3** (pinned to `v3.0.0-beta.26`, upgraded on purpose, never floating) + Svelte 5 + TypeScript + Vite |
| Why v3 | It can close windows and keep the app alive (the interface unloads while a game runs), has several windows (main and in-game overlay) and a built-in tray. v2 can only hide its one window. |
| Library storage | In memory, saved as one JSON file with atomic writes (changed from SQLite during v0.1: even thousands of games stay a few MB, it loads in milliseconds, and it saves a ~7 MB dependency; search and filters run in the interface) |
| Controller | SDL3 3.4.x (`SDL3.dll`, zlib license) through a small binding of our own over `golang.org/x/sys/windows`. No cgo. We need about 20 functions, all with integer arguments. |
| Shared code | `github.com/ApolloF/gamekit` (public, MIT): VDF (text and binary), Steam (folder, libraries, installed apps, account, Authenticode, tamper and emulator checks) and the Ludusavi manifest parser. Store detection (Epic, GOG, Xbox, …) stays in each app for now: Syncer only needs names, WaterLauncher needs launch details. |
| Syncer | Stays a separate app and gets a local API (named pipe, current user only). Needs Syncer 0.11+; see [syncer-api.md](syncer-api.md) |
| Add-ons | Separate executables using JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio. Their UI is declarative, so it renders natively in every layout. |
| Store games not installed | Optional, **off by default** |
| Desktop theme | Follows the Windows light or dark setting (Mica). Big picture is always dark. |
| License | MIT |
| Releases | Every phase version is published as a GitHub **prerelease** |

Data: `%APPDATA%\WaterLauncher` (`settings.json`, `library.json`, log), `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WaterLauncher\cache` (game database, images, WebView2 data).

## 4. Library and detection

| Source | Signal | Identity |
|---|---|---|
| Steam | `libraryfolders.vdf`, `appmanifest_*.acf` | AppID |
| Epic | `ProgramData\Epic\...\Manifests\*.item` | catalog namespace and item |
| GOG | registry `GOG.com\Games`, `goggame-*.info` | GOG ID |
| EA, Ubisoft, Battle.net, Xbox | same as Syncer's `installed.go` | store IDs |
| Emulated Steam | `steam_appid.txt`, `steam_settings\` (Goldberg/GSE), `steam_emu.ini` (CODEX), RUNE/EMPRESS/TENOKE/SmartSteamEmu configs, `OnlineFix.ini`, an unsigned `steam_api(64).dll` | AppID from the files |
| GOG rips | `goggame-*.info` outside a GOG install | GOG ID |
| Repacks and installers | Uninstall registry entries (Inno Setup and others): `InstallLocation`, `DisplayIcon` | by title |
| Shortcuts | Start menu and desktop `.lnk` targets | by title |
| Watched folders | every subfolder is a candidate, live updates through `ReadDirectoryChangesW` | by title |

- **Identify:** exact ID first, then the Ludusavi manifest (install folder name to title and AppID, already used by Syncer), then PCGamingWiki, then normalised fuzzy title matching. Each match gets a confidence score. Low-confidence matches wait in *Found on this PC* for a check (setting on by default).
- **Main exe:** prefer the launcher exe in the game's root folder and known engine patterns; skip uninstallers, redistributables and crash handlers. Signals include version info and icon.
- **Duplicates:** the same folder or the same store ID merges. A store copy and an unofficial copy can both exist and are labelled.
- **Owned but not installed (opt-in, v0.7):**
  - Steam: `IPlayerService/GetOwnedGames` with the user's own Web API key (DPAPI) and the SteamID of the account in use (from `gamekit/steam`).
  - GOG: Galaxy's `galaxy-2.0.db`, read with a small read-only SQLite reader (`internal/sqlite`, WAL included) instead of a ~7 MB SQLite library.
  - Epic: the public launcher client's OAuth. The user signs in on epicgames.com and pastes the one-time code; only the refresh token is kept (DPAPI).
  - Owned-only games are library records keyed `owned:<store>:<id>`. A scan that finds the game installed merges them and keeps the user's choices.
  - *Install* opens the store (`steam://install/…`, `goggalaxy://openGameView/…`, `com.epicgames.launcher://apps/…?action=install`).
- **Speed:** the first scan runs in parallel, and later scans are incremental, driven by watchers.

## 5. Metadata and art

- **Steam (no key; checked 2026-09-25):** `store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails` gives the description, genres, developer, release date and categories (55 DualShock, 57/58 DualSense, 28 full controller support). `IStoreBrowseService/GetItems` with `include_assets` gives the library cover, hero, logo and header. This covers every emulated-Steam copy too.
- **GOG:** `api.gog.com/products/{id}`. **SteamGridDB:** optional key, for games without a Steam ID and to pick alternative covers. Games the manifest doesn't know are also looked up on the Steam store by exact title.
- **PCGamingWiki** was dropped during v0.2: its API now refuses Cargo queries. Controller support comes from Steam's store categories (DualShock 55, DualSense 57/58) and from the game's files (Sony's `libScePad.dll`, or SDL, which handles a DualSense itself).
- **Fallback:** a generated cover from the title plus the icon pulled from the exe.
- **Image pipeline:** HTTPS to allowlisted hosts only, with size and time limits. Every image is decoded and re-encoded (which strips anything hidden in the file) at the sizes the UI needs, stored by content hash, and served through the asset handler with long cache lifetimes. An accent colour is extracted per game for glows and the lightbar.
- User overrides (title, cover, hero) are never overwritten by a refresh.

## 6. Launching, tracking, controller

- **Launch:** Steam games use `steam://rungameid/…` (setting: direct exe). Everything else starts with `CreateProcess`: explicit path, working folder and argument array, no shell. Elevation happens only when the game's manifest requires it.
- **Tracking:** the process tree plus matching on the install folder, which covers launcher-to-game handoffs. It polls every 2 s only while a game runs. Playtime is saved every minute. Steam playtime is imported from `localconfig.vdf`. Optional passive tracking of games started outside WaterLauncher isn't built yet: it needs polling while idle, which works against the idle budget.
- **Command line:** `WaterLauncher.exe --play <id>` starts a game without opening the interface (for shortcuts).
- **Hooks pipeline:** before launch (Syncer sync, add-ons) and after exit (Syncer backup, add-ons). Each step has a timeout, progress and a skip option, and the result is shown in the launch sequence.
- **DualSense (SDL3):**
  - Features: hotplug, glyph detection (PS or Xbox), haptic ticks, a lightbar in the game's accent colour, and the PS button to summon the launcher.
  - While a game runs, WaterLauncher releases the controller and keeps only a passive PS-button listener. It sends no output reports and never switches the controller's report mode.
- **Per-game controller mode:** *Auto* / *Native* / *Steam Input*.
  - Auto uses Steam categories 55/57/58, Steam's controller support field, and whether `libScePad.dll` or SDL is in the game folder. A game goes through Steam Input only when a PlayStation controller is in use and the game supports Xbox controllers but not PlayStation ones.
  - The Steam Input route uses non-Steam shortcuts that WaterLauncher manages in `shortcuts.vdf`, in a "WaterLauncher" collection. Changes are applied while Steam is closed, or after asking to restart it. These games launch through `steam://rungameid/<shortcut>`.
- **Game mode:** all interface windows close; the smoke test measured about 420 MB for WebView2 alone. WaterLauncher stays in the tray (pulled forward from v1.0, because game mode needs it). Closing the window yourself quits, except while a game runs. Pressing PS opens a borderless topmost overlay window. Nothing is ever injected into games, so anti-cheat stays happy.
  - Measured in v0.4: the Go core uses about 35 MB while a game runs with the interface closed.
  - Passive listening restarts SDL without its HIDAPI drivers and with enhanced reports off, so nothing is written to the controller.

## 7. Interface

- The **Big picture** layouts share the focus engine (spatial navigation in zones), input intents (keyboard, or gamepad events from Go; the browser gamepad API isn't used), glyphs, sounds, haptics, an on-screen keyboard for search, and a controller-friendly Settings screen.
- **Desktop D:** filters, cover grid, details panel, Settings window. It auto-switches to big picture when a controller connects (setting).
- **Speed:** virtualised grids and rows, animations only on transform and opacity, images pre-sized, `content-visibility`, and reduced motion respected.
- **Themes:** CSS token sets per layout. User theme packs (tokens only, no JavaScript) come later.
- **Mock backend:** the frontend runs in a normal browser with fake data, for fast iteration and screenshots.

## 8. Syncer integration

Done in v0.5. Syncer's side is [ApolloF/syncer#7](https://github.com/ApolloF/syncer/pull/7); the protocol is Syncer's [docs/api.md](https://github.com/ApolloF/syncer/blob/main/docs/api.md), and WaterLauncher's use of it is in [syncer-api.md](syncer-api.md).

1. Syncer imports `gamekit` for VDF, Steam libraries, tamper checks and the manifest parser. `internal/steam` keeps its API as thin wrappers, and the manifest parser gives identical results (13,719 games with Windows saves).
2. `\\.\pipe\syncer`: JSON-RPC, one message per line, served by the window. A protected DACL grants only the current user, and remote clients are refused. `Syncer.exe --api` serves it without a window and exits a minute after the last connection. The client checks the server process's owner.
3. Methods: `status`, `games`, `gameStatus` (by title, Steam app, install folder, or a title the launcher registered), `syncNow` (with timeout), `backupNow` (optionally waiting), `conflicts`, `resolveConflict`, `open`, `registerGames`, `subscribe` (`changed` notifications).
4. The protocol is versioned (`status.protocol`, now 1). WaterLauncher handles Syncer being missing (*Get Syncer*) or older than 0.11 (*Update Syncer*; it never starts an old `Syncer.exe --api`, which would open its window).

Follow-ups in Syncer, after its `feature/steam-autocloud-copies` work lands: use `gamekit/steam.Accounts`, and let registered launcher games feed discovery (for now they only help `gameStatus`).

## 9. Add-ons

- **Manifest** `addon.json`: id, name, version, publisher, exe, protocol version, hooks, contributions (badges, actions, a settings schema) and permissions (for example `modifyGameFiles`, `network`).
- **Hooks:** `library.gameAdded`, `game.beforeLaunch` (progress, skip), `game.afterExit`, `game.status`, `game.actions`, `settings`.
- **Trust:** you enable each add-on explicitly and see its permissions. WaterLauncher pins its SHA-256 and asks again when it changes, and shows the Authenticode publisher when signed. Add-ons run with normal user rights, with timeouts and crash isolation.
- **DLSS Updater:** a new `--addon` mode ([ApolloF/dlssupdater#1](https://github.com/ApolloF/dlssupdater/pull/1)). *Settings → General → Connect to WaterLauncher* writes its `addon.json`. The .NET 8 SDK (8.0.425) is installed per user in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\dotnet`.
  - Before launch: re-apply DLSS if a game patch reverted it.
  - Status: DLSS and OptiScaler versions.
  - Actions: install OptiScaler, restore DLSS, open in DLSS Updater.
- The spec is [addon-protocol.md](addon-protocol.md).
- **Where add-ons live:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WaterLauncher\addons\<id>\addon.json`. Approvals (enabled, pinned SHA-256) are in `%APPDATA%\WaterLauncher\addons.json`.
- **Before-launch order:** Syncer's *Sync saves* first, then add-ons, then the Steam Input shortcut.
- **Authenticode:** only the signed or unsigned state is shown for now, not the publisher's name. `library.gameAdded` goes only to add-ons that are running.

## 10. Security

- **WebView:** strict CSP with no remote scripts. Navigation away from the app is blocked, devtools and the context menu are off in release, only bound services are exposed, and every value from the UI is validated in Go (paths must resolve inside known roots).
- **Network:** allowlisted hosts, HTTPS, size limits, and images re-encoded. The only executable ever downloaded is WaterLauncher's own update from GitHub Releases, checked against its SHA-256.
- **Secrets:** the SteamGridDB key, Steam Web API key and Epic token are stored with DPAPI and never logged.
- **Parsers:** VDF, ini, JSON, lnk and ACF files are treated as untrusted, with size limits and fuzz tests.
- **Privileges:** WaterLauncher never elevates itself. The Syncer pipe is current-user only. Add-ons are covered in section 9.

## 11. Performance budget (this laptop: Ryzen 7 7840HS, 16 GB)

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Cold start to interactive | < 1 s desktop, < 1.5 s big picture |
| Incremental scan / first full scan | < 300 ms / < 3 s |
| Navigation with 2,000 games | 60 fps |
| Idle CPU | about 0 % (event-driven, no polling without a running game) |
| Memory while playing | Go core < 50 MB (interface unloaded) |
| Installer | < 20 MB |

## 12. Phases

Each phase ends with a working build, a GitHub prerelease and a check-in.

| # | Version | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | v0.1 | Scaffold (Wails v3, Svelte 5, CI). Steam playtime import (pulled forward from v0.4). Detection code copied into `internal/` for now, split into `gamekit` in phase 5. SQLite schema, scanner (stores, unofficial, folders), Desktop D with real data (grid, filters, details), Settings skeleton, mock backend |
| 2 | v0.2 | Metadata and art (Steam, GOG, SteamGridDB; PCGamingWiki dropped), image pipeline, accent colours, *Found on this PC* review |
| 3 | v0.3 | Big picture: focus engine, SDL3 controller layer, **Deck** first, then Console, then Orbit; glyphs, haptics, lightbar, on-screen keyboard |
| 4 | v0.4 | Launch and tracking, hooks pipeline, game mode (with tray), PS-button overlay, Steam Input routing, `--play` (playtime import moved to v0.1) |
| 5 | v0.5 | `gamekit` repo and Syncer PR (pipe API, `--api`), launcher client, save status, conflicts, backup after exit |
| 6 | v0.6 | Add-on protocol, host and permissions UI; DLSS Updater `--addon` PR |
| 7 | v0.7 | Owned-but-not-installed games from Steam, GOG and Epic (opt-in) |
| 8 | v1.0 | NSIS installer, auto-update, start with Windows, code signing, docs, release (see section 17) |

## 13. Testing

- **Go:** fixture folders for every detection signature, golden tests for identification, fuzz tests for parsers, and tests for the launch and tracking state machine.
- **Frontend:** `svelte-check` and Vitest (focus engine, intents). The mock backend is checked visually at 1600×1000 and 1920×1080.
- **Performance:** a fake-library generator with 2,000 games, measuring fps and memory.
- **Controllers:** a checklist per phase covering DualSense over USB and Bluetooth, and an Xbox controller.
- **CI:** GitHub Actions on `windows-latest` runs the tests and a build. Tagged versions build the installer.

## 14. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Wails v3 is a beta that ships every few days | Pinned version, deliberate upgrades, thin Wails-specific layer |
| Steam only picks up `shortcuts.vdf` changes after a restart | Batch changes, apply when Steam is closed or after asking; only games that need Steam Input |
| DualSense shared between the launcher and a game (Bluetooth report mode) | Passive listener while playing, no output reports, can be turned off |
| Steam also claims the PS button | Setting explained in Controller settings; detect and warn |
| Overlay over exclusive full-screen games | Recommend borderless windowed; overlay is optional; no injection |
| Metadata endpoints change | One provider per package, cache, fallback chain |
| Scope | Only installed games are managed; no download sources or crack tools |

## 15. Workflow and releases

- `main` always builds. Each phase gets a branch (`feature/v0.1-foundation`, and so on) and a PR, merged after tests and the build pass. Small fixes can go straight to `main`.
- At the end of each phase, the tag `vX.Y.0` makes GitHub Actions build `WaterLauncher.exe` (plus the installer once it exists) with SHA-256 checksums, and publishes a **prerelease** with notes on what changed and what to test.
- The Syncer and DLSS Updater changes (phases 5 and 6) happen in their own repos: `gamekit` as a new public repo, and PRs (or direct pushes to `main`) for Syncer and DLSS Updater.
- License: MIT.

## 16. Environment (set up 2026-09-25)

- Go 1.27.0, Wails CLI v3.0.0-beta.26, Node 24.19 and npm 11.17, NSIS, Git 2.55, GitHub CLI 2.101 (signed in as ApolloF, used as the Git credential helper), WebView2 153.
- Repo: `C:\Users\Florian\Documents\Coding projects\WaterLauncher`, branch `main`, remote `https://github.com/ApolloF/WaterLauncher` (public). Repo-local identity `ApolloF <me@apollof.nl>`.
- CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) builds and tests every push and PR on `windows-latest`. A `v*` tag publishes a prerelease with the exe, its SHA-256, and `docs/releases/<tag>.md` as notes.
- Smoke test: a Wails v3 Svelte app built in 34 s into a 10.5 MB exe. At runtime the Go process used about 67 MB and WebView2 about 423 MB.
- Installed later: SDL3 3.4.16 (phase 3, from the libsdl-org release, hash checked) and the .NET 8 SDK (phase 6).

## 17. v1.0 and after

**Built for v1.0**

- **Installer** (`build/windows/nsis/project.nsi`): per-user (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\WaterLauncher`, no UAC), so updates never need elevation. It closes a running copy with `--quit`, remembers the install folder for updates, deletes only its own files on uninstall (the folder may have been picked by hand), removes the start-with-Windows entry, and asks before deleting the library and settings. `/relaunch` (and `/tray`) start WaterLauncher again after a silent update. About 7.5 MB with the WebView2 bootstrapper.
- **Updates** (`internal/update`, `internal/app/updates.go`): the newest non-preview release from `api.github.com/…/releases/latest`. Downloads come only from below `github.com/ApolloF/WaterLauncher/releases/download/` (redirects limited to GitHub's download hosts), are checked against the release's `.sha256`, and, once builds are signed, against the running exe's Authenticode publisher. Installed copies run the installer silently; others swap their exe (a running exe can be renamed). Checked 90 s after start and every 12 h, never while a game runs. A downloaded update installs at the next start (not with `--play`), or at once with *Restart and update*. `pending.json` counts attempts, so an update that didn't take isn't retried on its own.
- **Start with Windows**: `HKCU\…\Run\WaterLauncher = "<exe>" --tray`. Settings shows when Task Manager's switch turned it off, and the entry is repaired when WaterLauncher moved.
- **Single instance**: a second start hands its arguments over before the library is opened. The mutex name follows Wails beta.26; recheck it when upgrading Wails.
- **Signing**: `build/windows/sign.ps1` and the CI secrets `SIGN_PFX_BASE64`/`SIGN_PFX_PASSWORD`; unsigned until a certificate exists.
- **CI**: builds the installer, signs when configured, publishes `v1+` tags without a suffix as full releases (`make_latest`), and runs the race detector when gcc is available.
- **Checked by hand on this PC**: silent install to a folder with spaces, `--quit` with and without a running copy, an installer update from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 started at sign-in (`--tray`) that relaunched in the tray and tidied up, an exe-swap update of a copy that wasn't installed (including the no-retry guard), and a silent uninstall that removed the files, shortcuts, Run entry and uninstall key while keeping the data.

**Audit (2026-09-26)**, fixed in v1.0:

| Area | Finding | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Data safety | The save timer and quitting could write `library.json.tmp` at the same time and corrupt the library (it was then set aside and a fresh one started) | Saves serialized; the file loaded at start is kept as `library.json.bak` and used when the main file is damaged |
| Data safety | Quitting mid-game lost up to a minute of playtime (`Launch.Close` didn't wait) | Close waits up to 3 s for the playtime hand-over |
| Performance | The owned-games merge compared every owned game with every found game, under the write lock: 126 ms per scan with 3,500 games | Index by store id: 0.46 ms |
| Performance | Every scan walked each shortcut's folder (up to 4,000 entries) and each game folder for its size: 550–800 ms repeat scans on this PC | Cached by folder modification time, and sizes for 6 h: 63 ms |
| Performance | Each metadata result, favorite or playtime tick reloaded the whole library in the interface | `games:updated` carries just the changed games |
| Idle cost | SDL was polled every 8 ms forever, with or without a controller (~400 ms CPU per 30 s idle) | 250 ms without a controller, 33 ms in games, 16/8 ms in use, not at all when off: too little to measure |
| Idle cost | Scans, metadata and owned-games syncs ran during games | They wait until the game ends; memory is returned to Windows when the interface closes and after big batches |
| Leaks | Art replaced by refreshes, and art of removed games, was never deleted | Unused art pruned once per start (a day's grace) |
| Robustness | An add-on that stopped reading stdin blocked writes while holding the lock its reader needed (deadlock), and could hang shutdown | Separate write lock; the goodbye is sent in the background |
| Robustness | The image decode limit of 50 megapixels allowed ~200 MB spikes | 24 megapixels |
| Startup | A second instance (every `--play` shortcut) opened the library, settings and add-ons before handing over | Checked before anything is loaded |

Checked and fine: no known vulnerabilities in Go modules (govulncheck) or npm packages (npm audit); the CSP injected into release builds; URL and host allowlists in `meta`, `owned` and `update`; DPAPI secrets never logged; the Syncer pipe owner check; add-on hash pinning; size-limited, fuzzed parsers; no shell anywhere.

**Next (recommendations)**

1. **Get a signing certificate** (SignPath Foundation is free for open source), then signature-required updates switch on by themselves. Also consider signing each release's checksums with an ed25519 key kept outside GitHub: today a compromised GitHub account could replace both an asset and its `.sha256`.
2. **Memory while playing**: the Go core is ~75 MB private with the interface closed (goal < 50 MB). The game database index is ~15 MB live; the rest needs a heap profile (`pprof`) to attribute (SDL, Wails, runtime). An interned or on-disk index would help, and GOG's database could be read by pages instead of whole.
3. **Scan cost per game**: emulator detection and exe picking still read each game folder on every scan (~5–30 ms per game), so with hundreds of games a full scan takes seconds. Cache them by folder and marker-file modification times, like `looksLikeGame` now.
4. **Passive play tracking** of games started outside WaterLauncher: a process-start event subscription (WMI `Win32_ProcessStartTrace`) avoids polling while idle.
5. **Tests**: Vitest for the focus engine and big picture navigation; a Playwright run of the mock interface at the two target sizes; an installer smoke test in CI (silent install to a temp folder, `--quit`, silent uninstall, as done by hand for v1.0).
6. **Wails**: v3 is still beta; keep the pin, and when upgrading recheck the single-instance mutex name, event payloads and bindings.
7. **Uninstall tidy-up**: offer to remove the non-Steam shortcuts WaterLauncher added to Steam (they're in a "WaterLauncher" collection).
8. **Localisation**: the interface is English only, with strings inline in components. Extract them before adding languages.
9. **Diagnostics**: panics in the core only reach the log; a *Copy diagnostics* button (log tail, versions, settings without secrets) would make bug reports easier.

## 18. v1.1 plan (started 2026-09-26)

Recommendations 1 to 4 of section 17, on `feature/v1.1`. Order: 3, 2, 4 (code only), then 1 (needs decisions and accounts from the user). Each part lands with tests and a measurement, then one v1.1.0 release.

**Status (2026-09-26):** A, B, C and D1 done; D2 prepared, waiting for SignPath's approval. Outcomes:

- A: repeat enrich of 100 generated games (1,000 files each) 700–830 ms → 8 ms; repeat scans on this PC 63 ms → 18 ms.
- B: private bytes in the tray 79 MB → 62 MB. The < 50 MB goal isn't reachable with Wails: a bare Wails v3 app is 46 MB here (importing it loads shell32 and friends at init; a plain Go program is 12 MB). What's left of ours is ~16 MB. The heap profile showed the game database index as nearly all of the Go heap.
- C: done as planned; checked by hand with a folder game started from Explorer.
- D1: key made 2026-09-26 on the maintainer's PC (public key in `internal/update/keys.go`); CI makes drafts; `tools/release` signs and publishes. **The offline backup has to be made by the maintainer** (it asks for a password).
- D2: CI steps for SignPath (two signing rounds, uninstaller built separately with `-DINNER` / `-DSIGNED_UNINSTALLER`, checked locally by installing and uninstalling with a separately built uninstaller). Setup steps in [SIGNING.md](SIGNING.md).

### A. Scan cost per game (recommendation 3)

Problem: `DetectEmulation` walks each game folder (up to 30,000 entries, 7 levels) and `PickExe` walks it again (20,000 entries, 4 levels) on every scan: 5–30 ms per game here, seconds with hundreds of games.

1. **One walk**: `scan.Inspect(dir, title)` does both in a single `WalkDir`, returning the emulation result, the picked exe and a *fingerprint*.
2. **Fingerprint**: the modification times of the folders that matter (the root, every folder to depth 2, and every folder holding a marker, a `steam_api*.dll` or an exe candidate), plus size and time of the marker files and DLLs. Adding, removing or renaming a file changes its folder's time; an in-place replacement (a patched `steam_api64.dll`) changes the file's own.
3. **Cache** per folder in memory: a later scan only stats the fingerprint (tens of calls) and reuses the result when nothing moved. A full walk still happens at least once a day per game and at every start.
4. **Measure** with a generated library (`scan` benchmark: 100 games of ~2,000 files each in a temp folder) and on this PC. Target: repeat enrich of 500 games under 300 ms total.

### B. Memory while playing (recommendation 2)

Problem: the core holds ~75 MB private with the interface closed; goal < 50 MB.

1. **Attribute first**: `WL_HEAPPROFILE=<file>` writes a Go heap profile 60 s after a game starts (or on `--quit`); compare Go heap (`runtime.MemStats`) with the process's private bytes to split Go from native (SDL, Wails, WebView2 loader).
2. **Game database index** (~15 MB live, the biggest known item): only scans use it, and scans wait while a game runs. Hold it through a `weak.Pointer` and reload it from the cached file (~1 MB gzip) when the next scan needs it after the GC dropped it; drop the strong reference when a game starts.
3. **GOG Galaxy database**: read pages with `ReadAt` from the open file instead of loading up to 512 MB whole.
4. **Native side**: check SDL in passive mode (HIDAPI off) and Wails' idle allocations once the profile shows them; set `debug.SetMemoryLimit` only if the profile shows GC headroom as the cause.
5. **Measure** before and after on this PC: private bytes 60 s into a game with the interface closed.

### C. Games started outside WaterLauncher (recommendation 4)

Problem: playtime and game mode only work for games started from WaterLauncher. A game started from Steam or a desktop shortcut isn't noticed, and the controller layer stays in its active mode (SDL's HIDAPI drivers) while that game has the DualSense.

1. **No polling**: a WinEvent hook on `EVENT_SYSTEM_FOREGROUND` (out of context, no injection, no administrator rights) on a small thread with its own message loop. Each time a window comes to the front, its process id arrives. (WMI's `Win32_ProcessStartTrace` would need administrator rights, and the non-admin WMI query polls.)
2. **Match**: the process's image path against the installed games' folders (a sorted index built after each scan); WaterLauncher's own processes and non-game folders are skipped; each process id is checked once.
3. **Session**: an "external" session in `launch.Manager` without hooks: the existing tracker follows the process tree and the folder, counts playtime, and ends the same way. The controller goes passive (or off, per setting), the tray says what's playing, the PS button opens the overlay. The interface isn't closed for a game you started elsewhere.
4. **Setting**: *Notice games started outside WaterLauncher* (on by default) under *While playing*, in both Settings screens.
5. **Tests**: the matcher and session start with fake processes; by hand: start a Steam game from Steam and a folder game from Explorer.

### D. Signed releases (recommendation 1)

Two independent parts.

1. **Release signature, key outside GitHub** (so a compromised GitHub account can't ship an update):
   - `tools/release`: `keygen` makes an ed25519 key pair; the private key is stored encrypted with DPAPI on the maintainer's PC and exported once, password-protected, for an offline backup.
   - CI publishes tags as **draft** releases. `go run ./tools/release publish vX.Y.Z` downloads the draft's assets, checks their `.sha256`, writes `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.sig`, uploads both and publishes the release. Drafts are invisible to the updater.
   - The updater embeds the public key(s) and, from v1.1 on, installs only updates whose hash is listed in a `SHA256SUMS` with a valid signature. v1.0 keeps using the `.sha256` files, so v1.0 → v1.1 still works.
   - Rotation: a list of accepted keys; a new key is added by a release signed with the old one.
2. **Authenticode** (SmartScreen, and the publisher check the updater already has): SignPath Foundation (free for open source) signs from GitHub Actions after they approve the project. Needs the user to apply. Then: sign `WaterLauncher.exe`, build the uninstaller separately so it can be signed too (NSIS can't call a remote signer mid-build), sign the installer.

Decisions for the user: where the release key lives and how it's backed up; whether to apply to SignPath (or pay for Azure Artifact Signing).

## 19. v1.2 (2026-09-26)

On `feature/v1.2`.

1. **Safer releases**: `tools/release cut` (RELEASING.md) after a masked merge failure nearly tagged v1.1.0 on a `main` without its code; CI's installer smoke test (silent install, `--tray`, `--quit`, silent uninstall, no crash output).
2. **Diagnostics and crash capture**: `debug.SetCrashOutput` into `crash.log` (kept as `crash-previous.log` by the next start, which says so), *Copy diagnostics* / *Report a problem* in *Settings → About*, `--diagnostics` for when the interface won't open, interface errors into the log. The report shortens the user folder and holds no keys or account names.
3. **Saves after games started elsewhere**: a noticed game's session gets Syncer's after-exit backup (started, not waited on). Syncer syncs continuously and backs up every few hours by itself, so this only adds a restore point right after the session; the before-launch sync can't apply to a game that's already running.

## To-do (maintainer)

- [ ] **Back up the release key** before the next release: `go run ./tools/release backup <file>` in a terminal (it asks for a password). Keep the file offline and the password elsewhere. Without it, losing this PC strands v1.1+ users on their version ([RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md)).
- [ ] **Apply to SignPath Foundation** (signpath.org) for Authenticode signing. Once approved: the project, signing policy and the `binaries` and `installer` artifact configurations in SignPath, then the `SIGNPATH_API_TOKEN` secret and `SIGNPATH_*` variables on GitHub ([SIGNING.md](SIGNING.md)). Until then releases carry the release-key signature but no Authenticode signature, so SmartScreen warns on first run.
- [ ] Turn on GitHub's private vulnerability reporting (Settings → Security), which [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) points to.
